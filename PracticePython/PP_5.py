'''
Take two lists, say for example these two:
  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
  b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists
(without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.

Extras:
Randomly generate two lists to test this
Write this in one line of Python
'''
import random as rd
def listInter(A, B):
    C = []
    D = set(A)
    for d in D:
        for b in B:
            if d == b:
                C.append(d)
    print(C)
A = rd.sample(range(1, 101), 20)
B = rd.sample(range(1, 101), 15)
print(A, B)
listInter(A, B)
